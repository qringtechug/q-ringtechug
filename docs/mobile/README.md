# Mobile — Q-Ring V1

This folder contains mobile app architecture, BLE integration guides, API specs, UI guidelines, and a starter Flutter app scaffold.

The app is responsible for:
- Pairing with Q-Ring over BLE
- Receiving feature vectors and emotion events
- Running heavier inference (if needed) and UI presentation
- Syncing aggregated data to cloud (user consent)
- Onboarding & calibration flows
