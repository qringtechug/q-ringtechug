# Q-Ring V1 — Development Roadmap (12 months)

## Goal
Deliver a validated Q-Ring V1 prototype, run pilot tests, and prepare for a 500-unit beta production run.

---

### Phase 0 — Preparation (Weeks 0–2)
- Finalize product specs and feature list
- Prepare BOM and supplier list
- Create initial GitHub repo and documentation

### Phase 1 — Prototype (Weeks 3–8)
- Order dev boards and sensors (MAX30102, GSR, TMP117, MPU-6050)
- Build macro (breadboard) prototype
- Develop firmware to stream sensor data via BLE
- Create initial mobile app mockups (Figma)

### Phase 2 — AI Development & Calibration (Weeks 7–12)
- Collect baseline public datasets (WESAD, DEAP)
- Build baseline emotion classifier (Python/TensorFlow)
- Implement 7-day calibration flow for personalization

### Phase 3 — Integrated Alpha (Months 3–4)
- Integrate sensors into a single PCB (prototype)
- Embed TinyML model on-device (TFLite)
- Recruit 20–50 alpha testers and collect labeled data

### Phase 4 — Beta (Months 5–7)
- Refine hardware and PCB design
- Small-batch manufacturing (500 units)
- Run 100–250 user pilot, refine UX & model performance

### Phase 5 — Pre-Production & Launch Prep (Months 8–10)
- Certification & safety testing
- Finalize packaging & supply chain
- Marketing & early-access pre-orders

### Phase 6 — Launch (Months 10–12)
- Fulfill pre-orders
- Expand subscription features
- Begin enterprise outreach
